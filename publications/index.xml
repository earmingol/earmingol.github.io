      <description>&lt;p&gt;Metabolism supplies energy, building blocks, and signaling molecules vital for&#xA;cell function and communication, but methods to directly measure it at single-cell&#xA;and/or spatial resolutions remain technically challenging and inaccessible for most&#xA;researchers. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics offer high-throughput data alternatives&#xA;with a rich ecosystem of computational tools. Here, we present scCellFie, a computational&#xA;framework to infer metabolic activities from human and mouse transcriptomic data at&#xA;single-cell and spatial resolution. Applied to ∼30 million cell profiles, we generated&#xA;a comprehensive metabolic atlas across human organs, identifying organ– and&#xA;cell-type-specific activities. In the endometrium, scCellFie reveals metabolic&#xA;programs contributing to healthy tissue remodeling during the menstrual cycle, with&#xA;temporal patterns replicated in data from in vitro cultures. We also uncover&#xA;disease-associated metabolic alterations in endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma,&#xA;linked to proinflammatory macrophages, and metabolite-mediated epithelial cell&#xA;communication, respectively. Ultimately, scCellFie provides a scalable toolbox for&#xA;extracting interpretable metabolic functionalities from transcriptomic data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No cell lives in a vacuum, and the molecular interactions between cells define most phenotypes.&#xA;Transcriptomics provides rich information to infer cell–cell interactions and communication,&#xA;thus accelerating the discovery of the roles of cells within their communities. Such research&#xA;relies heavily on algorithms that infer which cells are interacting and the ligands and receptors&#xA;involved. Specific pressures on different research niches are driving the evolution of next-generation&#xA;computational tools, enabling new conceptual opportunities and technological advances.&#xA;More sophisticated algorithms now account for the heterogeneity and spatial organization of&#xA;cells, multiple ligand types and intracellular signalling events, and enable the use of larger&#xA;and more complex datasets, including single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. Similarly,&#xA;new high-throughput experimental methods are increasing the number and resolution of interactions&#xA;that can be analysed simultaneously. Here, we explore recent progress in cell–cell interaction&#xA;research and highlight the diversification of the next generation of tools, which have yielded&#xA;a rich ecosystem of tools for different applications and are enabling invaluable discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inferring a spatial code of cell-cell interactions across a whole animal body</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cell-cell interactions shape cellular function and ultimately organismal&#xA;phenotype. Interacting cells can sense their mutual distance using&#xA;combinations of ligand-receptor pairs, suggesting the existence of a&#xA;spatial code, i.e., signals encoding spatial properties of cellular&#xA;organization. However, this code driving and sustaining the spatial&#xA;organization of cells remains to be elucidated. Here we present a&#xA;computational framework to infer the spatial code underlying cell-cell&#xA;interactions from the transcriptomes of the cell types across the whole&#xA;body of a multicellular organism. As core of this framework, we introduce&#xA;our tool cell2cell, which uses the coexpression of ligand-receptor pairs&#xA;to compute the potential for intercellular interactions, and we test it&#xA;across the Caenorhabditis elegans’ body. Leveraging a 3D atlas of&#xA;C. elegans’ cells, we also implement a genetic algorithm to identify the&#xA;ligand-receptor pairs most informative of the spatial organization of&#xA;cells across the whole body. Validating the spatial code extracted with&#xA;this strategy, the resulting intercellular distances are negatively&#xA;correlated with the inferred cell-cell interactions. Furthermore, for&#xA;selected cell-cell and ligand-receptor pairs, we experimentally confirm&#xA;the communicatory behavior inferred with cell2cell and the genetic&#xA;algorithm. Thus, our framework helps identify a code that predicts the&#xA;spatial organization of cells across a whole-animal body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Context-aware deconvolution of cell-cell communication with Tensor-cell2cell</title>
      <link>https://earmingol.github.io/publications/tensor/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cell interactions determine phenotypes, and intercellular communication is shaped by cellular contexts such as disease&#xA;state, organismal life stage, and tissue microenvironment. Single-cell technologies measure the molecules mediating&#xA;cell–cell communication, and emerging computational tools can exploit these data to decipher intercellular communication.&#xA;However, current methods either disregard cellular context or rely on simple pairwise comparisons between samples,&#xA;thus limiting the ability to decipher complex cell–cell communication across multiple time points, levels of disease&#xA;severity, or spatial contexts. Here we present Tensor-cell2cell, an unsupervised method using tensor decomposition,&#xA;which deciphers context-driven intercellular communication by simultaneously accounting for multiple stages, states,&#xA;or locations of the cells. To do so, Tensor-cell2cell uncovers context-driven patterns of communication associated&#xA;with different phenotypic states and determined by unique combinations of cell types and ligand-receptor pairs.&#xA;As such, Tensor-cell2cell robustly improves upon and extends the analytical capabilities of existing tools.&#xA;We show Tensor-cell2cell can identify multiple modules associated with distinct communication processes (e.g.,&#xA;participating cell–cell and ligand-receptor pairs) linked to severities of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and to Autism&#xA;Spectrum Disorder. Thus, we introduce an effective and easy-to-use strategy for understanding complex communication&#xA;patterns across diverse conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deciphering cell-cell interactions and communication from gene expression</title>
      <link>https://earmingol.github.io/publications/cci-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cell–cell interactions orchestrate organismal development, homeostasis and&#xA;single-cell functions. When cells do not properly interact or improperly&#xA;decode molecular messages, disease ensues. Thus, the identification and&#xA;quantification of intercellular signalling pathways has become a common&#xA;analysis performed across diverse disciplines. The expansion of protein–protein&#xA;interaction databases and recent advances in RNA sequencing technologies have&#xA;enabled routine analyses of intercellular signalling from gene expression&#xA;measurements of bulk and single-cell data sets. In particular, ligand–receptor&#xA;pairs can be used to infer intercellular communication from the coordinated&#xA;expression of their cognate genes. In this Review, we highlight discoveries&#xA;enabled by analyses of cell–cell interactions from transcriptomic data and&#xA;review the methods and tools used in this context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding the impact of the cofactor swapping of isocitrate dehydrogenase over the growth phenotype of Escherichia coli on acetate by using constraint-based modeling</title>
      <link>https://earmingol.github.io/publications/ecoli-fba/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been proposed that NADP+-specificity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH)&#xA;evolved as an adaptation of microorganisms to grow on acetate as the sole&#xA;source of carbon and energy. In Escherichia coli, changing the cofactor&#xA;specificity of ICDH from NADP+ to NAD+ (cofactor swapping) decreases the&#xA;growth rate on acetate. However, the metabolic basis of this phenotype has&#xA;not been analyzed. In this work, we used constraint-based modeling to&#xA;investigate the effect of the cofactor swapping of ICDH in terms of energy&#xA;production, response of alternative sources of NADPH, and partitioning of&#xA;fluxes between ICDH and isocitrate lyase (ICL) -a crucial bifurcation when&#xA;the bacterium grows on acetate-. We generated E. coli strains expressing&#xA;NAD+-specific ICDH instead of the native enzyme, and bearing the deletion&#xA;of the NADPH-producing transhydrogenase PntAB. We measured their growth rate&#xA;and acetate uptake rate, modeled the distribution of metabolic fluxes by Flux&#xA;Balance Analysis (FBA), and quantified the specific activities of&#xA;NADPH-producing dehydrogenases in central pathways. The cofactor swapping&#xA;of ICDH led to one-third decrease in biomass yield, irrespective of the&#xA;presence of PntAB. According to our simulations, the diminution in growth&#xA;rate observed upon cofactor swapping could be explained by one-half decrease&#xA;in the total production of NADPH and a lower availability of carbon for&#xA;biosynthesis because of a change in the partition at the isocitrate&#xA;bifurcation. Together with an increased total ATP production, this scenario&#xA;resulted in a 10-fold increment in the flux of ATP not used for growing&#xA;purposes. PntAB was identified as the primary NADPH balancing response,&#xA;with the dehydrogenases of the oxidative branch of the Pentose Phosphate&#xA;Pathway and the malic enzyme playing a role in its absence. We propose that&#xA;in the context of E. coli growing on acetate, the NADP+-specificity of ICDH&#xA;is a trait that impacts not only NADPH production, but also the efficient&#xA;allocation of carbon and energy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
