      <title>Cell-cell interactions and communication</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In multicellular organisms, high-order organizations of cells are defined by&#xA;their cell-cell interactions (CCIs). Cells constantly sense their&#xA;microenvironment and can trigger intracellular changes depending on the&#xA;information that they receive. These communicatory processes allow single&#xA;cells to coordinate their gene expression, which further enables the&#xA;coordination of a collective behavior of cells. Thus, functions and&#xA;phenotypes of multicellular organizations are orchestrated by their CCIs. The&#xA;main focus of my research is on generating novel approaches to infer CCIs to&#xA;help decipher how phenotypes are associated and how they depend on these&#xA;processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cellular metabolism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cellular metabolism orchestrates the supply of resources and energy needed for&#xA;the diversity of cellular functions, including protein synthesis, cellular growth&#xA;and motility. Therefore, quantifying metabolic activities within individual cells&#xA;in tissues is essential for understanding their physiological roles and potential&#xA;alterations in aging and diseases. Additionally mapping these metabolic activities&#xA;spatially within tissues is vital for insights into how cells work synergistically&#xA;to perform complex tasks and how these functions change in disease states. By leveraging&#xA;metabolic modeling with novel strategies to understand metabolism from genomics data, I aim&#xA;to elucidate how metabolic activities help to perform cellular functions, shaping phenotypes under&#xA;different biological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
