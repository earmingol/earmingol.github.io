Single-cell technologies measure the molecules mediating cell-cell communication, and emerging computational tools can exploit these data to decipher intercellular communication. However, current methods either disregard cellular context or rely on simple pairwise comparisons between samples, thus limiting the ability to decipher complex cell-cell communication across multiple time points, levels of disease severity, or spatial contexts. Here we present Tensor-cell2cell, an unsupervised method using tensor decomposition, which is the first strategy to decipher context-driven intercellular communication by simultaneously accounting for multiple stages, states, or locations of the cells. To do so, Tensor-cell2cell uncovers context-driven patterns of communication associated with different phenotypic states and determined by unique combinations of cell types and ligand-receptor pairs. We show Tensor-cell2cell can identify multiple modules associated with distinct communication processes (e.g., participating cell-cell and ligand receptor pairs) linked to COVID-19 severities. Thus, we introduce an effective and easy-to-use strategy for understanding complex communication patterns across diverse conditions.\n https://youtu.be/fOEWkVf2vk0?list=PLkef4SGmngdbi1Tl_sL8qNF5sf_7_g__Z\u0026amp;t=3701\n","permalink":"https://earmingol.github.io/publications/tensor/","tags":["RNA-seq","single-cell","transcriptomics","cell-cell communication","cellular contexts","tensor factorization"],"title":"Context-aware deconvolution of cell-cell communication with Tensor-cell2cell"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Talk given in the ACCDiS Seminars about single-cell transcriptomics applied to understand chronic diseases   ","permalink":"https://earmingol.github.io/publications/accdis-talk/","tags":["RNA-seq","single-cell","transcriptomics","tools","cell-cell communication","tensor factorization","cellular contexts"],"title":"Tensor-cell2cell: Desde la transcriptómica a entender cómo el contexto biológico afecta la comunicación intercelular"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Talk given in the workshop about single-cell RNA-seq organized by the Human Cell Atlas for the Latin American community.

However, the spatial code embedded in the molecular interactions driving and sustaining spatial organization remains to be elucidated. Here we present a computational framework to infer the spatial code underlying cell-cell interactions in a whole animal. Using the transcriptomes of the cell types composing Caenorhabditis elegans’ body, we compute the potential for intercellular interactions from the coexpression of ligand-receptor pairs. Leveraging a 3D atlas of C. elegans’ cells and a genetic algorithm we identify the ligand-receptor pairs most informative of the spatial organization of cells. The resulting intercellular distances are negatively correlated with the potential for cell-cell interaction, validating this strategy. Further, for selected ligand-receptor pairs, we experimentally confirm the algorithm-generated cell-cell interactions. Thus, our computational framework helps identify a code associated with spatial organization and cellular functions across a whole-animal body, showing that single-cell molecular measurements provide spatial information that may help elucidate organismal phenotypes and disease.\n","permalink":"https://earmingol.github.io/publications/cci-celegans/","tags":["RNA-seq","single-cell","transcriptomics","cell-cell interactions","cell-cell communication","Caenorhabditis elegans"],"title":"Inferring a spatial code of cell-cell interactions across a whole animal body"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Cell–cell interactions orchestrate organismal development, homeostasis and single-cell functions. When cells do not properly interact or improperly decode molecular messages, disease ensues. Thus, the identification and quantification of intercellular signalling pathways has become a common analysis performed across diverse disciplines. The expansion of protein–protein interaction databases and recent advances in RNA sequencing technologies have enabled routine analyses of intercellular signalling from gene expression measurements of bulk and single-cell data sets. In particular, ligand–receptor pairs can be used to infer intercellular communication from the coordinated expression of their cognate genes.

In Escherichia coli, changing the cofactor specificity of ICDH from NADP+ to NAD+ (cofactor swapping) decreases the growth rate on acetate. However, the metabolic basis of this phenotype has not been analyzed. In this work, we used constraint-based modeling to investigate the effect of the cofactor swapping of ICDH in terms of energy production, response of alternative sources of NADPH, and partitioning of fluxes between ICDH and isocitrate lyase (ICL) -a crucial bifurcation when the bacterium grows on acetate-. We generated E. coli strains expressing NAD+-specific ICDH instead of the native enzyme, and bearing the deletion of the NADPH-producing transhydrogenase PntAB. We measured their growth rate and acetate uptake rate, modeled the distribution of metabolic fluxes by Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and quantified the specific activities of NADPH-producing dehydrogenases in central pathways. The cofactor swapping of ICDH led to one-third decrease in biomass yield, irrespective of the presence of PntAB. According to our simulations, the diminution in growth rate observed upon cofactor swapping could be explained by one-half decrease in the total production of NADPH and a lower availability of carbon for biosynthesis because of a change in the partition at the isocitrate bifurcation. Together with an increased total ATP production, this scenario resulted in a 10-fold increment in the flux of ATP not used for growing purposes. PntAB was identified as the primary NADPH balancing response, with the dehydrogenases of the oxidative branch of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway and the malic enzyme playing a role in its absence. We propose that in the context of E. coli growing on acetate, the NADP+-specificity of ICDH is a trait that impacts not only NADPH production, but also the efficient allocation of carbon and energy.\n","permalink":"https://earmingol.github.io/publications/ecoli-fba/","tags":["flux balance analysis","Escherichia coli","metabolism","isocitrate dehydrogenase","cofactors"],"title":"Understanding the impact of the cofactor swapping of isocitrate dehydrogenase over the growth phenotype of Escherichia coli on acetate by using constraint-based modeling"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\nTool to use together with COBRApy.
