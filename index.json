Transcriptomics provides rich information to infer cell–cell interactions and communication, thus accelerating the discovery of the roles of cells within their communities. Such research relies heavily on algorithms that infer which cells are interacting and the ligands and receptors involved. Specific pressures on different research niches are driving the evolution of next-generation computational tools, enabling new conceptual opportunities and technological advances. More sophisticated algorithms now account for the heterogeneity and spatial organization of cells, multiple ligand types and intracellular signalling events, and enable the use of larger and more complex datasets, including single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. Similarly, new high-throughput experimental methods are increasing the number and resolution of interactions that can be analysed simultaneously. Here, we explore recent progress in cell–cell interaction research and highlight the diversification of the next generation of tools, which have yielded a rich ecosystem of tools for different applications and are enabling invaluable discoveries.\nThis review was featured on the cover of the Nature Reviews Genetics' issue for June 2024.\n","permalink":"https://earmingol.github.io/publications/cci-reviewv2/","tags":["RNA-seq","single-cell","transcriptomics","cell-cell interactions","cell-cell communication","high-throughput experiments"],"title":"The diversification of methods for studying cell–cell interactions and communication"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Cell-cell interactions shape cellular function and ultimately organismal phenotype. Interacting cells can sense their mutual distance using combinations of ligand-receptor pairs, suggesting the existence of a spatial code, i.e., signals encoding spatial properties of cellular organization. However, this code driving and sustaining the spatial organization of cells remains to be elucidated. Here we present a computational framework to infer the spatial code underlying cell-cell interactions from the transcriptomes of the cell types across the whole body of a multicellular organism. As core of this framework, we introduce our tool cell2cell, which uses the coexpression of ligand-receptor pairs to compute the potential for intercellular interactions, and we test it across the Caenorhabditis elegans’ body. Leveraging a 3D atlas of C. elegans’ cells, we also implement a genetic algorithm to identify the ligand-receptor pairs most informative of the spatial organization of cells across the whole body. Validating the spatial code extracted with this strategy, the resulting intercellular distances are negatively correlated with the inferred cell-cell interactions. Furthermore, for selected cell-cell and ligand-receptor pairs, we experimentally confirm the communicatory behavior inferred with cell2cell and the genetic algorithm. Thus, our framework helps identify a code that predicts the spatial organization of cells across a whole-animal body.\n","permalink":"https://earmingol.github.io/publications/cci-celegans/","tags":["RNA-seq","single-cell","transcriptomics","cell-cell interactions","cell-cell communication","Caenorhabditis elegans"],"title":"Inferring a spatial code of cell-cell interactions across a whole animal body"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Cell interactions determine phenotypes, and intercellular communication is shaped by cellular contexts such as disease state, organismal life stage, and tissue microenvironment. Single-cell technologies measure the molecules mediating cell–cell communication, and emerging computational tools can exploit these data to decipher intercellular communication. However, current methods either disregard cellular context or rely on simple pairwise comparisons between samples, thus limiting the ability to decipher complex cell–cell communication across multiple time points, levels of disease severity, or spatial contexts. Here we present Tensor-cell2cell, an unsupervised method using tensor decomposition, which deciphers context-driven intercellular communication by simultaneously accounting for multiple stages, states, or locations of the cells. To do so, Tensor-cell2cell uncovers context-driven patterns of communication associated with different phenotypic states and determined by unique combinations of cell types and ligand-receptor pairs. As such, Tensor-cell2cell robustly improves upon and extends the analytical capabilities of existing tools. We show Tensor-cell2cell can identify multiple modules associated with distinct communication processes (e.g., participating cell–cell and ligand-receptor pairs) linked to severities of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and to Autism Spectrum Disorder. Thus, we introduce an effective and easy-to-use strategy for understanding complex communication patterns across diverse conditions.\nRead our Behind the Paper post here: https://go.nature.com/3a5nL7Z  ","permalink":"https://earmingol.github.io/publications/tensor/","tags":["RNA-seq","single-cell","transcriptomics","cell-cell communication","cellular contexts","tensor factorization"],"title":"Context-aware deconvolution of cell-cell communication with Tensor-cell2cell"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Talk given in the ACCDiS Seminars about single-cell transcriptomics applied to understand chronic diseases   ","permalink":"https://earmingol.github.io/publications/accdis-talk/","tags":["RNA-seq","single-cell","transcriptomics","tools","cell-cell communication","tensor factorization","cellular contexts"],"title":"Tensor-cell2cell: Desde la transcriptómica a entender cómo el contexto biológico afecta la comunicación intercelular"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Talk given in the workshop about single-cell RNA-seq organized by the Human Cell Atlas for the Latin American community.

Thus, the identification and quantification of intercellular signalling pathways has become a common analysis performed across diverse disciplines.

In particular, ligand–receptor pairs can be used to infer intercellular communication from the coordinated expression of their cognate genes.

In Escherichia coli, changing the cofactor specificity of ICDH from NADP+ to NAD+ (cofactor swapping) decreases the growth rate on acetate. However, the metabolic basis of this phenotype has not been analyzed. In this work, we used constraint-based modeling to investigate the effect of the cofactor swapping of ICDH in terms of energy production, response of alternative sources of NADPH, and partitioning of fluxes between ICDH and isocitrate lyase (ICL) -a crucial bifurcation when the bacterium grows on acetate-. We generated E. coli strains expressing NAD+-specific ICDH instead of the native enzyme, and bearing the deletion of the NADPH-producing transhydrogenase PntAB. We measured their growth rate and acetate uptake rate, modeled the distribution of metabolic fluxes by Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and quantified the specific activities of NADPH-producing dehydrogenases in central pathways. The cofactor swapping of ICDH led to one-third decrease in biomass yield, irrespective of the presence of PntAB. According to our simulations, the diminution in growth rate observed upon cofactor swapping could be explained by one-half decrease in the total production of NADPH and a lower availability of carbon for biosynthesis because of a change in the partition at the isocitrate bifurcation. Together with an increased total ATP production, this scenario resulted in a 10-fold increment in the flux of ATP not used for growing purposes. PntAB was identified as the primary NADPH balancing response, with the dehydrogenases of the oxidative branch of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway and the malic enzyme playing a role in its absence. We propose that in the context of E. coli growing on acetate, the NADP+-specificity of ICDH is a trait that impacts not only NADPH production, but also the efficient allocation of carbon and energy.\n","permalink":"https://earmingol.github.io/publications/ecoli-fba/","tags":["flux balance analysis","Escherichia coli","metabolism","isocitrate dehydrogenase","cofactors"],"title":"Understanding the impact of the cofactor swapping of isocitrate dehydrogenase over the growth phenotype of Escherichia coli on acetate by using constraint-based modeling"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\nTool to use together with COBRApy.

These communicatory processes allow single cells to coordinate their gene expression, which further enables the coordination of a collective behavior of cells. Thus, functions and phenotypes of multicellular organizations are orchestrated by their CCIs.
