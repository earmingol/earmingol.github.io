      <title>Atlas-scale metabolic activities inferred from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Metabolism supplies energy, building blocks, and signaling molecules vital for&#xA;cell function and communication, but methods to directly measure it at single-cell&#xA;and/or spatial resolutions remain technically challenging and inaccessible for most&#xA;researchers. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics offer high-throughput data alternatives&#xA;with a rich ecosystem of computational tools. Here, we present scCellFie, a computational&#xA;framework to infer metabolic activities from human and mouse transcriptomic data at&#xA;single-cell and spatial resolution. Applied to ∼30 million cell profiles, we generated&#xA;a comprehensive metabolic atlas across human organs, identifying organ– and&#xA;cell-type-specific activities. In the endometrium, scCellFie reveals metabolic&#xA;programs contributing to healthy tissue remodeling during the menstrual cycle, with&#xA;temporal patterns replicated in data from in vitro cultures. We also uncover&#xA;disease-associated metabolic alterations in endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma,&#xA;linked to proinflammatory macrophages, and metabolite-mediated epithelial cell&#xA;communication, respectively. Ultimately, scCellFie provides a scalable toolbox for&#xA;extracting interpretable metabolic functionalities from transcriptomic data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding the impact of the cofactor swapping of isocitrate dehydrogenase over the growth phenotype of Escherichia coli on acetate by using constraint-based modeling</title>
      <link>https://earmingol.github.io/publications/ecoli-fba/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been proposed that NADP+-specificity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH)&#xA;evolved as an adaptation of microorganisms to grow on acetate as the sole&#xA;source of carbon and energy. In Escherichia coli, changing the cofactor&#xA;specificity of ICDH from NADP+ to NAD+ (cofactor swapping) decreases the&#xA;growth rate on acetate. However, the metabolic basis of this phenotype has&#xA;not been analyzed. In this work, we used constraint-based modeling to&#xA;investigate the effect of the cofactor swapping of ICDH in terms of energy&#xA;production, response of alternative sources of NADPH, and partitioning of&#xA;fluxes between ICDH and isocitrate lyase (ICL) -a crucial bifurcation when&#xA;the bacterium grows on acetate-. We generated E. coli strains expressing&#xA;NAD+-specific ICDH instead of the native enzyme, and bearing the deletion&#xA;of the NADPH-producing transhydrogenase PntAB. We measured their growth rate&#xA;and acetate uptake rate, modeled the distribution of metabolic fluxes by Flux&#xA;Balance Analysis (FBA), and quantified the specific activities of&#xA;NADPH-producing dehydrogenases in central pathways. The cofactor swapping&#xA;of ICDH led to one-third decrease in biomass yield, irrespective of the&#xA;presence of PntAB. According to our simulations, the diminution in growth&#xA;rate observed upon cofactor swapping could be explained by one-half decrease&#xA;in the total production of NADPH and a lower availability of carbon for&#xA;biosynthesis because of a change in the partition at the isocitrate&#xA;bifurcation. Together with an increased total ATP production, this scenario&#xA;resulted in a 10-fold increment in the flux of ATP not used for growing&#xA;purposes. PntAB was identified as the primary NADPH balancing response,&#xA;with the dehydrogenases of the oxidative branch of the Pentose Phosphate&#xA;Pathway and the malic enzyme playing a role in its absence. We propose that&#xA;in the context of E. coli growing on acetate, the NADP+-specificity of ICDH&#xA;is a trait that impacts not only NADPH production, but also the efficient&#xA;allocation of carbon and energy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
