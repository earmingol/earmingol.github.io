      <title>Computational suite for studying cell-cell interactions and communication</title>

      <description>The suite cell2cell includes two main sub-tools:  The regular cell2cell, which includes the main approaches described in our review. Tensor-cell2cell, a novel method that uses tensor factorization to deconvolve patterns of cell-cell communication across multiple cellular contexts (e.g., time points, disease states, cellular location, patients, etc.), as described in our research article.    A toy example using the under-the-hood methods of cell2cell is available here. This case allows personalizing the analyses in a higher level, but it may result harder to use.</description>

      <title>Inferring a spatial code of cell-cell interactions across a whole animal body</title>

      <description>Cell-cell interactions shape cellular function and ultimately organismal phenotype. However, the spatial code embedded in the molecular interactions driving and sustaining spatial organization remains to be elucidated. Here we present a computational framework to infer the spatial code underlying cell-cell interactions in a whole animal. Using the transcriptomes of the cell types composing Caenorhabditis elegans’ body, we compute the potential for intercellular interactions from the coexpression of ligand-receptor pairs. Leveraging a 3D atlas of C.</description>

      <title>Deciphering cell-cell interactions and communication from gene expression</title>

      <description>Cell–cell interactions orchestrate organismal development, homeostasis and single-cell functions. When cells do not properly interact or improperly decode molecular messages, disease ensues. Thus, the identification and quantification of intercellular signalling pathways has become a common analysis performed across diverse disciplines. The expansion of protein–protein interaction databases and recent advances in RNA sequencing technologies have enabled routine analyses of intercellular signalling from gene expression measurements of bulk and single-cell data sets. In particular, ligand–receptor pairs can be used to infer intercellular communication from the coordinated expression of their cognate genes.</description>

      <description>In multicellular organisms, high-order organizations of cells are defined by their cell-cell interactions (CCIs). Cells constantly sense their microenvironment and can trigger intracellular changes depending on the information that they receive. These communicatory processes allow single cells to coordinate their gene expression, which further enables the coordination of a collective behavior of cells. Thus, functions and phenotypes of multicellular organizations are orchestrated by their CCIs. The main focus of my research is on generating novel approaches to infer CCIs to help decipher how phenotypes are associated and how they depend on these processes.</description>
