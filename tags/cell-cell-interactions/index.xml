      <description>The suite cell2cell includes two main sub-tools:  The regular cell2cell, which includes the main approaches described in our review. Tensor-cell2cell, a novel method that uses tensor factorization to deconvolve patterns of cell-cell communication across multiple cellular contexts (e.g., time points, disease states, cellular location, patients, etc.), as described in our research article.   Tutorials cell2cell Examples  Step-by-step Pipeline Interaction Pipeline for Bulk Data Interaction Pipeline for Single-Cell Data Whole Body of C.</description>

      <title>The diversification of methods for studying cell–cell interactions and communication</title>

      <description>No cell lives in a vacuum, and the molecular interactions between cells define most phenotypes. Transcriptomics provides rich information to infer cell–cell interactions and communication, thus accelerating the discovery of the roles of cells within their communities. Such research relies heavily on algorithms that infer which cells are interacting and the ligands and receptors involved. Specific pressures on different research niches are driving the evolution of next-generation computational tools, enabling new conceptual opportunities and technological advances.</description>

      <title>Inferring a spatial code of cell-cell interactions across a whole animal body</title>

      <description>Cell-cell interactions shape cellular function and ultimately organismal phenotype. Interacting cells can sense their mutual distance using combinations of ligand-receptor pairs, suggesting the existence of a spatial code, i.e., signals encoding spatial properties of cellular organization. However, this code driving and sustaining the spatial organization of cells remains to be elucidated. Here we present a computational framework to infer the spatial code underlying cell-cell interactions from the transcriptomes of the cell types across the whole body of a multicellular organism.</description>

      <title>Deciphering cell-cell interactions and communication from gene expression</title>

      <description>Cell–cell interactions orchestrate organismal development, homeostasis and single-cell functions. When cells do not properly interact or improperly decode molecular messages, disease ensues. Thus, the identification and quantification of intercellular signalling pathways has become a common analysis performed across diverse disciplines. The expansion of protein–protein interaction databases and recent advances in RNA sequencing technologies have enabled routine analyses of intercellular signalling from gene expression measurements of bulk and single-cell data sets. In particular, ligand–receptor pairs can be used to infer intercellular communication from the coordinated expression of their cognate genes.</description>

      <description>In multicellular organisms, high-order organizations of cells are defined by their cell-cell interactions (CCIs). Cells constantly sense their microenvironment and can trigger intracellular changes depending on the information that they receive. These communicatory processes allow single cells to coordinate their gene expression, which further enables the coordination of a collective behavior of cells. Thus, functions and phenotypes of multicellular organizations are orchestrated by their CCIs. The main focus of my research is on generating novel approaches to infer CCIs to help decipher how phenotypes are associated and how they depend on these processes.</description>
