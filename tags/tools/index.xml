      <description>The suite cell2cell includes two main sub-tools:
 The regular cell2cell, which includes the main approaches described in our review. Tensor-cell2cell, a novel method that uses tensor factorization to deconvolve patterns of cell-cell communication across multiple cellular contexts (e.g., time points, disease states, cellular location, patients, etc.), as described in our pre-print.    A toy example using the under-the-hood methods of cell2cell is available here. This case allows personalizing the analyses in a higher level, but it may result harder to use.</description>

      <title>Cell-cell interactions and communication</title>
      <link>https://earmingol.github.io/projects/research/ccis/</link>

      <description>In multicellular organisms, high-order organizations of cells are defined by their cell-cell interactions (CCIs). Cells constantly sense their microenvironment and can trigger intracellular changes depending on the information that they receive. These communicatory processes allow single cells to coordinate their gene expression, which further enables the coordination of a collective behavior of cells. Thus, functions and phenotypes of multicellular organizations are orchestrated by their CCIs. The main focus of my research is on generating novel approaches to infer CCIs to help decipher how phenotypes are associated and how they depend on these processes.</description>
