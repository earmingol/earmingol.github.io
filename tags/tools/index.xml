      <title>Computational suite for studying cell-cell interactions and communication</title>

      <description>The suite cell2cell includes two main sub-tools:  The regular cell2cell, which includes the main approaches described in our review. Tensor-cell2cell, a novel method that uses tensor factorization to deconvolve patterns of cell-cell communication across multiple cellular contexts (e.g., time points, disease states, cellular location, patients, etc.), as described in our research article.    A toy example using the under-the-hood methods of cell2cell is available here. This case allows personalizing the analyses in a higher level, but it may result harder to use.</description>

      <title>Cell-cell interactions and communication</title>
      <link>https://earmingol.github.io/projects/research/ccis/</link>

      <description>In multicellular organisms, high-order organizations of cells are defined by their cell-cell interactions (CCIs). Cells constantly sense their microenvironment and can trigger intracellular changes depending on the information that they receive. These communicatory processes allow single cells to coordinate their gene expression, which further enables the coordination of a collective behavior of cells. Thus, functions and phenotypes of multicellular organizations are orchestrated by their CCIs. The main focus of my research is on generating novel approaches to infer CCIs to help decipher how phenotypes are associated and how they depend on these processes.</description>

      <title>Cellular metabolism</title>

      <description>Cellular metabolism orchestrates the supply of resources and energy needed for the diversity of cellular functions, including protein synthesis, cellular growth and motility. Therefore, quantifying metabolic activities within individual cells in tissues is essential for understanding their physiological roles and potential alterations in aging and diseases. Additionally mapping these metabolic activities spatially within tissues is vital for insights into how cells work synergistically to perform complex tasks and how these functions change in disease states.</description>
