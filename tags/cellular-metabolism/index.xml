      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cellular metabolism orchestrates the supply of resources and energy needed for&#xA;the diversity of cellular functions, including protein synthesis, cellular growth&#xA;and motility. Therefore, quantifying metabolic activities within individual cells&#xA;in tissues is essential for understanding their physiological roles and potential&#xA;alterations in aging and diseases. Additionally mapping these metabolic activities&#xA;spatially within tissues is vital for insights into how cells work synergistically&#xA;to perform complex tasks and how these functions change in disease states. By leveraging&#xA;metabolic modeling with novel strategies to understand metabolism from genomics data, I aim&#xA;to elucidate how metabolic activities help to perform cellular functions, shaping phenotypes under&#xA;different biological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
